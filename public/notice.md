🚧 Infra Transparency & Community Support

Posted: November 1, 2025

Right now, DarkAge SMP is operating on free-tier infra.
Translation: it’s scrappy, it’s janky at peak load, and occasionally it just acts like a potato.

We’re planning a transition to paid infrastructure to stabilize:

chunk loading

tick performance

latency & uptime


But this requires community-driven growth.

There are two lanes where players can genuinely accelerate this transition:

Brand Growth Support
Share clips, screenshots, reels, edits.
Show the world what Tarka SMP / DarkAge SMP actually is.
Visibility drives demand. Demand drives investment.

Financial Support (Voluntary)
Donations directly help us migrate to premium infra earlier.
Zero forcing. Pure transparency.
Every contribution helps us skip bottlenecks and upgrade sooner.

we’re building this the garage-startup way —
from free tier → to paid tier → to premium tier —
with the community as the catalyst.
